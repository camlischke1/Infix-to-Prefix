# Infix-to-Prefix
Translates infix mathematical expressions to prefix and evaluates them


Read a series of infix expressions from an external file called "expressions.txt". The expressions contain constants between 0 and 9 and the operators (,), +, ⎼, *, /, and ^. ALL INFIX EXPRESSIONS MUST BE IN PROPER SYNTACTIC FORM

For each expression this will:
○ Output the original infix expression. 
○ Convert the expression to postfix and output the postfix expression. 
○ Evaluate the postfix expression and output the answer as an integer. ○ Convert the postfix expression back to infix and output the infix expression
